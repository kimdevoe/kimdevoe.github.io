## Ingredients
- 500 ml (2 c) Whole milk (3% fat)
- 100 g (1/2 c) Granulated sugar
- 80 g Egg yolk (approx. yolk of 4-5 eggs)
- 25 g Corn starch
- 25 g All purpose flour
- 2 teaspoon Vanilla bean paste (or vanilla extract)
- 50 g  (~3 T) Unsalted butter (82% fat, room temperature soft butter)

## Directions
1. In a large enough bowl, with the help of a Hand whisk, whick together sugar and egg yolk until slightly fluffy for about 1-2 minutes
2. Whisk in corn starch, flour, and vanilla with until thoroughly incorporated and have a smooth paste
3. Bring milk to boil in a saucepan on medium heat then remove it as soon as it starts simmering. Make sure it is simmering but not crazy boiling
4. Pour the warm milk over the egg yolk mixture slowly while whisking vigorously with a Hand whisk. This stage is effectively tempering the egg yolks and the mixture should already start to slightly thicken
5. Pour the mixture back into the saucepan and cook on medium heat for a few minutes until it thickens. Concretely it is approximately 1 min after the first boil. It might get lumpy first, don't worry just keep whisking and the cream will get smooth and glossy. It's worth to keep a good quality (so that the milk won't burn in it) small/medium sized saucepan for making pastry cream only
6. If in doubt, strain the pastry cream for a lump free, creamy end result
7. Add in room temperature soft butter and mix with a Rubber spatula until completely incorporated. It is worth to add the butter in 3 stages and mix well after each addition.
8. Pastry cream needs to completely cool before using it for desserts. Place the cream into a shallow bowl and cover the entire surface with plastic wrap to avoid skin forming on top. Store in fridge for 2-3 days
9. Once cooled, you may need to whisk the pastry cream again to get a smooth texture. Make sure you do not over mix it as it can get runny. Give it a few whisk only until smooth. Use it to fill tarts, eclairs, cakes etc
