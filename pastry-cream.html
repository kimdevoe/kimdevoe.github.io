Make sure it is simmering but not crazy boiling</span></p></li><li><p><span>Pour the warm milk over the egg yolk mixture slowly while whisking vigorously with a Hand whisk. This stage is effectively tempering the egg yolks and the mixture should already start to slightly thicken</span></p></li><li><p><span>Pour the mixture back into the saucepan and cook on medium heat for a few minutes until it thickens. Concretely it is approximately 1 min after the first boil. It might get lumpy first, don&#x27;t worry just keep whisking and the cream will get smooth and glossy. It&#x27;s worth to keep a good quality (so that the milk won&#x27;t burn in it) small/medium sized saucepan for making pastry cream only</span></p></li><li><p><span>If in doubt, strain the pastry cream for a lump free, creamy end result</span></p></li><li><p><span>Add in room temperature soft butter and mix with a Rubber spatula until completely incorporated. It is worth to add the butter in 3 stages and mix well after each addition.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Pastry cream needs to completely cool before using it for desserts. Place the cream into a shallow bowl and cover the entire surface with plastic wrap to avoid skin forming on top. Store in fridge for 2-3 days</span></p></li><li><p><span>Once cooled, you may need to whisk the pastry cream again to get a smooth texture. Make sure you do not over mix it as it can get runny. Give it a few whisk only until smooth. Use it to fill tarts, eclairs, cakes etc</span></p></li></ol><h2>Notes</h2></body></html>
